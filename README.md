# prework_repo

This Git repository was made as part of the General Assembly DSI bootcamp pre-work session in advance of the Fall 2018 program.  Excited to be learning the ropes of Git, Python, and data science!

To test out the "clone" function, I have made this change locally.  I expect to see this in my GitHub repository when I return my updates using "push".

This change was added remotely using the GitHub GUI.  It should be reflected on my local machine when I "pull".
